# 1. The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

```
A =

    2    1    3
    3    1    4
    5    7   12
```

We can easily figure out that the column vectors are dependent. But what's about the row vectors? Can you find out the linear combination which leads to 0 ?

A = CR

```
C =

   2   1
   3   1
   5   7
```

```
R =

   1   0   1
   0   1   1
```

Now we get a basis of the row space , and can easily figure out the linear combination.
