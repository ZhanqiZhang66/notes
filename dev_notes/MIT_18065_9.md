# 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems

1. Pseudo Inverse A⁺
2. Solve AᵀA = Aᵀb
3. Orthogonalize first
4. (AᵀA + δ²I)x = Aᵀb


- A mxn, A⁺ nxm
    - x in row space is going to column space, it is invertible
        - what does A⁺ is to take vector in column space back to row space.
        - ![](../imgs/MIT_18065_least2_1.png)
    - x in null space is to (0,0), it is not invertible
        - since A⁺ can only take vector in N(Aᵀ) back to (0,0)
